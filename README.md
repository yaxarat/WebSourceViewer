## Purpose
This is a simple app created to showcase the usage of shared `viewModel`. In this sample app, the two fragments (enter url screen & website-html screen) share a `viewModel` (`commonViewModel`) between them. This allows for state/data sharing without having to pass bundles during fragment transactions.

A simple diagram of this architecture would look like this:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Activity-->SharedViewModel;
    SharedViewModel-->Fragment1;
    SharedViewModel-->Fragment2;
```

The shared viewModel here is scoped to the lifecycle of the activity and can be accessed in child fragments via: 

```kotlin
private val sharedViewModel: SharedViewModel by activityViewModels()
```
